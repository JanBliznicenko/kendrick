A KECouplingExpression is an expression which is automatically generated for ODE equation in a model with meta-population and having a graph that describes the interaction between sub-populations.

Instance variables:
	- couplingExpressions:            <OrderedCollection>
	
couplingExpressions
	- A list of coupling expressions generated from event list of the equation. Each equation would be automatically added a list of coupling expressions

odeVariableSymbol
	- The variable name of the ODE
